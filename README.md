## How to Use Taco Proxy

Using Taco Proxy involves a few straightforward steps. The exact process may vary depending on your system setup and the application you're using with the proxy. Here’s a general guide:

#### For Module Use

1. **Install AlloyProxy:**
   ```bash
   npm install alloyproxy
   ```
2. **Configure Your Node App:**
   Set all your configurations in the main file for the Node app.
3. **Start Your App:**
   Unblock a website at `/prefix/[BASE64 ENCODED WEBSITE ORIGIN]/`. The path of the website does not have to be Base64 encoded.

Example using the Express.js framework:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const Alloy = require('alloyproxy');
const app = express();
const server = require('http').createServer(app);

const Unblocker = new Alloy({
    prefix: '/fetch/',
    request: [],
    response: [],
    injection: true,
});

app.use(Unblocker.app);
Unblocker.ws(server);

server.listen(8080);
```

#### For Sample Express Application

1. **Navigate to the Examples Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd examples/express
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies and Start:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

The demo application will run at `localhost:8080` by default, but the port can be configured in `config.json`.

#### For Sample Implementation

Add the following code to your server-side script (e.g., `app.js`):

```javascript
const Alloy = require('alloyproxy');
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);

const Unblocker = new Alloy({
    prefix: '/fetch/',
    request: [],
    response: [],
    injection: true,
});

app.use(Unblocker.app);
Unblocker.ws(server);

server.listen(8080);
```

#### Configure Your Device or Application

Configure your device or application to use the proxy by entering the proxy server address and port in the network settings. For example, in a web browser, go to the network or proxy settings and enter the Taco Proxy server address and port.

#### Connect to Taco Proxy Server

After configuring your device or application, connect to the Taco Proxy server to route your internet traffic through the proxy, masking your IP address and enhancing online privacy.

#### Start Browsing or Using Your Application

Once connected to the Taco Proxy server, you can browse the internet or use your application as usual. Your online activity will now be routed through the Taco Proxy server.
